# Made by Punks

A trustless, community-owned directory.

---

## The Punk Spirit

CryptoPunks belong to no one and everyone. They are a piece of internet history, a cultural artifact that sparked a movement. This directory exists to celebrate the builders who keep that spirit alive.

**Made by Punks is not a company.** There is no team, no token, no roadmap. It's a public good maintained by the community, for the community.

- **Trustless** - All data lives in markdown files on GitHub. No database, no backend, no single point of failure.
- **Permissionless** - Anyone can add their punk profile and projects via pull request.
- **Decentralized** - Fork it, remix it, make it your own. The code is MIT licensed.
- **Community-owned** - Maintainers are punk holders who volunteer their time.

This is lore that belongs to everyone. Take it and build.

## Add Your Punk Profile

Every punk can have their own page - like MySpace, but on-chain adjacent.

### 1. Fork the Repository

Go to [github.com/gwendall/madebypunks](https://github.com/gwendall/madebypunks) and fork the repo.

### 2. Create Your Punk File

Create a file `content/punks/[YOUR_PUNK_ID].md`

For example, if you own Punk #1234:

```
content/punks/1234.md
```

### 3. Add Your Profile

Write your markdown file:

```md
---
name: Your Name
twitter: your_handle
website: https://your-site.com
---

Write anything you want here! This is your MySpace page.

Share your story, your vision, your memes. Use markdown to format your content however you like.
```

**Available fields:**

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | No | Your display name |
| `twitter` | No | Twitter/X handle (without @) |
| `website` | No | Your personal website |

The content below the `---` is your bio. Go wild.

---

## Add Your Projects

Each project gets its own markdown file in `content/projects/`.

### Create a Project File

Create `content/projects/your-project-slug.md`:

> **Important:** The filename becomes the URL slug (e.g., `/p/your-project-slug`). Make sure it's unique!

```md
---
name: My Project
description: A brief description of what it does.
thumbnail: /projects/my-project.png
url: https://my-project.com
launchDate: 2024-01-15
tags:
  - Tool
  - Art
creators:
  - 1234
twitter: project_handle
github: https://github.com/user/repo
discord: https://discord.gg/invite
---

Optional longer description here. Use markdown for formatting.

### Multiple Creators

Projects can have multiple creators! Just list all the punk IDs:

```yaml
creators:
  - 8070  # Matt Hall
  - 5072  # John Watkinson
```

The project will appear on both punk profile pages.

### Add a Thumbnail

For best results, add your project thumbnail to `public/projects/`:

```
public/projects/my-project.png
```

Then reference it in your frontmatter:

```yaml
thumbnail: /projects/my-project.png
```

Recommended size: 1200x630px (OG image dimensions).

## Become a Maintainer

Want to help review PRs and keep the directory running?
