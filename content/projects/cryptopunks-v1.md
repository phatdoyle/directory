CryptoPunks V1 refers to the original smart contract released by Larva Labs on June 9, 2017. A critical bug was discovered after all 10,000 tokens were claimed, leading Larva Labs to create V2 on June 23, 2017, and airdrop new tokens to original claimants.

The V1 Punks project wraps these original tokens in ERC-721, allowing them to be traded. V1 tokens have a distinctive lavender background to distinguish them from the V2 navy/blue background.

The project is controversial - some see V1 as the "true original" CryptoPunks, while others consider V2 the legitimate version since Larva Labs replaced it. Regardless of the debate, V1 represents a unique piece of Ethereum and NFT history, predating the term "NFT" and the ERC-721 standard it later inspired.
