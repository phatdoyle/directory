CryptoPunks: Free to Claim is an epic 800+ page book published by Phaidon, one of the world's pre-eminent art book publishers. Co-edited by Nathalie Stone and Sean Bonner, it goes far beyond a simple catalog of all 10,000 CryptoPunks.

## What's Inside

- **In-depth Interview** - Hans Ulrich Obrist (Serpentine Galleries) interviews Matt Hall and John Watkinson
- **Essays & Commentary** - Contributions from Beeple, Emily Segal, Venkatesh Rao, Anika Meier, Alexis Ohanian, Mat Dryhurst, and Noam Segal
- **Complete Collection** - All 10,000 CryptoPunks documented
- **Historical Context** - The story of how CryptoPunks changed digital art

## How to Read It

The book is designed so you can pick it up, flip to a random section, and spend a few minutes reading. It's not a cover-to-cover read, but a collection of powerful standalone pieces.

Published by Phaidon in December 2024.
